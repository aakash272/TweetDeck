This is an app that tries to mimic the app "Tweet Deck" available on the app store. It has a cool scrolling function in which the user can swipe between table-views and a home screen. While this happens, the user's info on the home screen vanishes upwards. It reappears downwards from the top when the user swipes back from the second screen. This is implemented using only scroll-views and labels. It seems to be difficult to explain what happens so watching this on a simulator will be the best way to go.
All feedback is welcome!
